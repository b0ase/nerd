## 🛠️ Detailed NERD Daemon Build Plan

This section breaks down the development of the NERD daemon into smaller, actionable steps, including key design decisions that need to be made.

### **Phase 2 Implementation Details: BitTorrent Integration**

#### **1. NERD Daemon Project Setup**
- [x] Create a new project directory for the NERD daemon code (`nerd-daemon/`).
- [x] Choose a programming language for the daemon (**Decision: Go** for performance, concurrency, and productivity).
- [x] Set up basic project structure and dependencies.
- [x] Implement basic logging and configuration handling.
- [x] Choose a serialization format (**Decision: Protocol Buffers**).

#### **2. TCP/IP Networking Foundation**
- [x] Implement basic peer-to-peer communication over TCP/IP.
- [x] Handle incoming and outgoing peer connections.
- [x] Implement message serialization and deserialization.
- [x] **NEW**: Complete BitTorrent wire protocol implementation
- [x] **NEW**: Full message type support (standard + NERD-specific)
- [x] **NEW**: Handshake protocol with traditional BitTorrent compatibility

#### **Current Status: Phase 2 Complete! 🎉**

**✅ Completed in Phase 2:**
- Go project with proper module structure (`github.com/nerd-daemon`)
- Protocol Buffer message definitions for all BitTorrent + NERD message types
- Wire protocol implementation (`protocol.go`) with serialization/deserialization
- TCP networking with connection pooling and lifecycle management
- BitTorrent handshake protocol (traditional format for compatibility)
- Message handling for standard BitTorrent messages (choke, unchoke, interested, have, etc.)
- NERD-specific message types (PaymentRequest, PaymentProof, TokenBalance, QualityMetrics, GeographicHint)
- Complete P2P communication foundation

**🛠️ Implementation Highlights:**
- **Message Types**: 15+ message types including standard BitTorrent (0-9) and NERD extensions (100+)
- **Wire Protocol**: Binary protocol with length-prefixed messages and Protocol Buffer payloads
- **Handshake Compatibility**: Traditional BitTorrent handshake format for interoperability
- **Connection Management**: Thread-safe connection pool with proper cleanup
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for network operations and message parsing

#### **3. Distributed Hash Table (DHT) Implementation**
- [ ] Choose a DHT implementation strategy (e.g., Kademlia-based). *Design Question: Which DHT algorithm/library should we use?*
- [ ] Implement node ID generation.
- [ ] Implement finding closest nodes (`FIND_NODE` equivalent).
- [ ] Implement storing and retrieving content/peer information (`STORE`/`FIND_VALUE` equivalent).
- [ ] Implement node joining and leaving the DHT.
- [ ] Integrate peer quality metrics into DHT lookups. *Design Question: How will peer quality metrics influence DHT results?*

#### **4. NERD Tracker Server Implementation**
- [ ] Choose a protocol for tracker communication (e.g., HTTP, UDP). *Design Question: Which protocol is best for our tracker?*
- [ ] Implement tracker requests (announce, scrape).
- [ ] Implement peer listing based on content info hashes.
- [ ] Integrate payment tracking and BSV/token acceptance into tracker responses. *Design Question: How will payment information be exchanged via the tracker?*
- [ ] Implement basic load balancing/scaling for the tracker (future).

#### **5. Peer Exchange (PEX) Implementation**
